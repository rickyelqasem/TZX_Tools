NOW WITH SUPPORT FOR MAXDUINO ULTIMATE DEVICES

Windows Tool to help you use and update your MaxDuino, TZXduino, CASDuino, ArduiTape, ZXuiTape, CPCuiTape, BeebuiTape, MSXuiTape, MZuiTape and some features like UEF Extraction (coming soon)

MaxDuino:
  If you want to have the splash screen(logo) loaded you have to upload that before uploading the firmware
  
General:
  Make sure you select the right arduino board. For Nano most of the time it will be the OLD Bootloader type but if you find it wont upload then try the New bootloader
  NOTE: If you get a false positive malware warning you can ignore it. I have tried to make sure false postives have been eliminated. But let me know if you get one.

Very Simple tool to use:

Step1: Plug your Device into the USB port

Step2: Open TZX Tools

Step3: If you are using Maxduino upload the logo first

Step4 Select the firmware

Step5: Select the COM port

Step6: Choose which type of Arduino you use

Step7: Display you are using

Step7: Upload

If you do not know the I2C address use an I2C scanner sketch to find out > https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner/ < BTW not need for DigiWavuino as I'd built the detection into the firmware

I'll try to keep updating it as and when new Firmwares get released

TZXduino, CASduino and ArduiTape developed by Duncan Edwards and Andrew Beer

MaxDuino developed by Rafael Molina Chasserot

DigiWavuino developed by ME! 

To keep things legal please install the Arduino IDE. I don't need it installed but I am calling some exes.
