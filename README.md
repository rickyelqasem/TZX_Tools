If you do not know the I2C address use an I2C scanner sketch to find out > https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner/ < BTW not need for DigiWavuino as I'd built the detection into the firmware

I'll try to keep updating it as and when new Firmwares get released

TZXduino, CASduino and ArduiTape developed by Duncan Edwards and Andrew Beer

MaxDuino developed by Rafael Molina Chasserot, David Hooper and sometimes a little from myself. 

DigiWavuino developed by ME! 

To keep things legal please install the Arduino IDE. I don't need it installed, but I am calling some exes.
